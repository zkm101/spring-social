# Welcome #

Welcome to the Spring Social Project!

This project provides a Spring MVC Framework based API for developing social networking applications on
platforms such as [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com).  The goal of the project is to make developing scalable and testable social networking applications easier.  Currently, only Facebook is supported.  However, we plan to add support for Open Social as that platform matures.

There is currently a lot of confusion and complexity surrounding Facebook's APIs and the request model imposed on Facebook applications.  This project aims to simplify Java based Facebook application development and deployment by providing a consistent, reusable and well documented set of Spring MVC components.

Please note this project is still in its early development stages and therefore, has not yet released a stable API.
